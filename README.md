# Hyper C++

## An assortment of algorithms that'll get you hyper about C++

The only overarching theme to this library is speed.  Try out some new algorithms such as the spreadsheet stream, the STL-style reference vector, and the hierarchical search tree.  Most of these can be implemented in a few lines or less.

The support for this will increase over time, but in the meantime it's just a bunch of algorithms that I find incredibly useful in building optimized tools in less time.
